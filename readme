set Quantity 1 for PartID R4700
list all with Quantity 1

The set command will change the database,,,however, the list all with Quantity 1 will only work if you run it seperately.
Meaning you need to run this command again...because list only prints the structure that is current..the structure
gets updated when you read from the file again...which should be the updated one.
